 Masters in Operations Research and Electrical Engineering at [UMASS College of Engineering](https://engineering.umass.edu/). My research is on developing a Machine Learning algorithm for [precipitation nowcasting](http://www.ral.ucar.edu/general/press/brochures/nowcasting_broch_2014_04.pdf) (short term forecasting) by integrating data from various remote sensing networks such as [NEXRAD radars](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/nexradinv/), [GPS-Met networks](http://gpsmet.noaa.gov/) amd [Met sensors](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/asos/). The basic idea is we use spatiotemporal evolution of atmospheric water vapor measured by a network of GPS stations and precipitation fields measured by radars to predict future precipitation fields. More details about my research can be found in the [publications section](http://adityanagara.github.io/publications/).
