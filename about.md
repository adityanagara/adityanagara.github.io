I am graduate masters student studying operations research at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](http://engineering.umass.edu/). I am a Research Assistant at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department working in the Engineering Research Center for Collaborative Sensing of the Atmosphere [(CASA)](http://www.casa.umass.edu/). My research is on using machine learning to develop a [precipitation nowcasting](http://www.ral.ucar.edu/general/press/brochures/nowcasting_broch_2014_04.pdf) algorithm by integrating data from various remote sensing sensors [NEXRAD radars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEXRAD) and [GPS-Met networks](http://gpsmet.noaa.gov/).
