 I am currently persuing my Masters in Operations Research at [UMASS Amherst](https://engineering.umass.edu/). My research is on applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to capture spatiotemporal relationships between multiple weather variables for [precipitation nowcasting](http://www.ral.ucar.edu/general/press/brochures/nowcasting_broch_2014_04.pdf) (short term forecasting of rainfall) by integrating data from various remote sensing networks such as [NEXRAD radars](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/nexradinv/), [GPS-Met networks](http://gpsmet.noaa.gov/) and [Met sensors](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/asos/). You can find more details about my research in the [publications section](http://adityanagara.github.io/publications/).
