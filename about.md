I am graduate masters student studying operations research at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](http://engineering.umass.edu/). I am a Research Assistant at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department working at the Engineering Research Center for Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere [(CASA)](http://www.casa.umass.edu/). My research is on using machine learning to develop a [precipitation nowcasting](http://www.ral.ucar.edu/general/press/brochures/nowcasting_broch_2014_04.pdf) algorithm by integrating data from various remote sensing sensors [NEXRAD radars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEXRAD) and [GPS-Met networks](http://gpsmet.noaa.gov/). The basic idea is that we use spatiotemporal evolution of atmospheric water vapor measured by a network of GPS stations and precipitation fields measured by radars to predict future precipitation fields. More details about my research can be found in the [publications section].
